Q.1) Create the following database in 3NF using PostgresSQL.
Consider the following Student-Teacher database maintained by a college. It also gives
information of the subject taught by the teachers.
Student (Sno integer, sname varchar (20), sclass varchar (10), saddr varchar (30))
Teacher (Tno integer, tname varchar (20), qualification char (15), experience integer)
Relationship:
Student-Teacher related with many to many relationship with descriptive attribute
Subject
Constraints: Primary Key, student and teacher name should not be null.
Draw ER diagram and Normalization diagram for above relational schema.
Using above database solve the following questions.
A. Create a View
1. To display details of teachers having experience > 5 years.
2. To display details of teachers whose name start with the letter ‘S’.
B. Write a function to count the number of the teachers who are teaching to a student named
‘ ’. (Accept student name as input parameter).
ANS:
1) Create table Student (sno int primary key, s_name char(30), s_class char(10), s_addr
Char(50));
2) Create table Teacher (tno int primary key, t_name char (20), qualification char
(15),experience integer);
3) Create table ST (sno int references Student, tno int references Teacher, subject text);

1. To display details of teachers having experience > 5 years.
ANS:

2. To display details of teachers whose name start with the letter ‘S’.
ANS:

B. Write a function to count the number of the teachers who are teaching to a student named
‘ ’. (Accept student name as input parameter).
ANS:
create  or replace function disp_teach(text)
returns void as'
declare
cnt int;
begin
select into cnt count(tno) from student,st where student.sno=st.sno  and s_name=$1;
raise notice ''No. of teachers teaching :=%'',cnt;
end;'
language 'plpgsql';
