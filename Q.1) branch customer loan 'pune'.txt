Q.1) Create the following database in 3NF using PostgreSQL.
Consider the following Bank database which maintains information about its branches,
customers and their loan applications.
Branch (Bid integer, brname varchar (30), brcity varchar (10))
Customer (Cno integer, cname varchar (20), caddr varchar (35), city varchar (15))
Loan_application (Lno integer,l_amt_required money,lamtapproved money, l_date date)
Relationship:
Branch, Customer, Loan_application are related with ternary relationship as follows:
Ternary (Bid integer, Cno integer, Lno integer)
Constraints: Primary key, l_amt_required should be greater than zero.
Draw ER diagram and Normalization diagram for above relational schema.
Using above database solve the following questions.
A. Create a View
1. To display names of customers for the ‘Pune’ branch.
2. To display names of customers who have taken loan from the branch in the same city
they live.
B. Write a stored function to count number of customers of particular branch. (Accept branch
name as an input parameter).

ANS:
1) create table Customer (C_no int primary key, Cname text, Caddress text,   
   City text);

2) create table Branch (Bid int primary key, brname text, Brcity text);

3) create table LA (Lno int primary key, lamtreq float, lamtapp float, ldate date);

because of ternary relationship craete one more table of relationship.

4)create table ternary(C_no int references Customer on delete cascade, Bid int references Branch on delete cascade, Lno  int references LA on delete cascade);




Lab=# select * from customer;
 c_no | cname  | caddress |  city  
------+--------+----------+--------
    1 | Ramesh | Pimpri   | Pune
    2 | Ram    | Mumbai   | Mumbai
(2 rows)

Lab=# select * from branch;
 bid |    brname    | brcity 
-----+--------------+--------
 101 | Shivajinagar | Pune
 102 | Deccan       | Pune
(2 rows)

Lab=# select * from la;
 lno | lamtreq | lamtapp |   ldate    
-----+---------+---------+------------
  11 |  200000 |  100000 | 2020-02-09
(1 row)

Lab=# select * from ternary;
 c_no | bid | lno 
------+-----+-----
    1 | 101 |  11
(1 row)

1.> To display names of customers for the ‘Pune’ branch.
Lab=# select cname from customer,branch,ternary where customer.c_no=ternary.c_no and branch.bid=ternary.bid and brname='pune';

2.> To display names of customers who have taken loan from the branch in the same city
they live.

B. >Write a stored function to count number of customers of particular branch. (Accept branch
name as an input parameter).
ANS: 
create  or replace function tot_cust(text)
returns void as'
declare
cnt int;
b_name alias for $1;
begin
select into cnt count(c_no) from branch,ternary where branch.bid=ternary.bid and brname=b_name;
raise notice ''Total No. of Customers are:= %'',cnt;
end;'
language 'plpgsql';
----------------------------------------------------------------------
select tot_cust('Aundh');
