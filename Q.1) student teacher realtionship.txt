Q.1) Create the following database in 3NF using PostgresSQL.
Consider the following Student-Teacher database maintained by a college. It also gives
information of the subject taught by teachers.
Student (Sno integer, sname varchar (20), sclass varchar (10), saddr varchar(30))
Teacher (Tno integer, tname varchar (20), qualification char (15), experience integer)
Relationship: Student-Teacher related with many to many relationship with descriptive
attribute Subject.
Constraints: Primary Key, student and teacher name should not be null.
Draw ER diagram and Normalization diagram for above relational schema.
Using above database solve the following questions.
A. Create a View
1. To display student names who are taught by most experienced teacher.
2. To display subjects taught by each teacher.
B. Write a trigger before update a student’s class from student table. Display appropriate
message.
ANS:
1) Create table Student (sno int primary key, s_name char(30), s_class char(10), s_addr
Char(50));
2) Create table Teacher (tno int primary key, t_name char (20), qualification char
(15),experience integer);
3) Create table ST (sno int references Student, tno int references Teacher, subject text);

1. To display student names who are taught by most experienced teacher.
ANS:create or replace view v2 as select t_name from teacher where experience=(select max(experience)
from teacher);

2. To display subjects taught by each teacher.
ANS:create or replace view v2 as select distinct(t_name), subject from teacher,st where
teacher.tno=st.tno;


B. Write a trigger before update a student’s class from student table. Display appropriate
message.
ANS:
create or replace function befup()
returns trigger as'
declare
begin
if(new.s_class != old.s_class ) then
raise Notice '' Student class being Updated'';
end if;
return new;
end;'
language 'plpgsql';

/*Trigger Code */
create trigger befup
before update on student
for each row
execute procedure befup();


Lab=# update student
Lab-# set s_class='SYBCA'
Lab-# where sno=3;
NOTICE:   Student class being Updated
UPDATE 1
